testing robot 29: 
GyroX,Y offsets are about 24.0 rad/frame
testing robot 41:
-0.008, 0.03

* these offsets are not consistent across robot, need calibrate each one individually

running robot 46 for 20 minutes:
joint temperature high (3 of them above 70).

GyroX,Y offset before: 0.0087, 0.0078
after: 0.0097, 0.0148 

*need to calibrate whenever in still position
